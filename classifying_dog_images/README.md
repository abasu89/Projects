AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree (AIPND) program. In this project, students focus on developing Python code for a pre-defined dog image classifier.

The dataset has not been included in this repository due to file size limitations. It is available at the AIPND program website; please contact me if you need it as it is only available for download to alumni of the program.
