# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree (AIPND) program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

The dataset is not included in this repository due to file size limitations. It can be downloaded from the AIPND program website; please contact me if you need it as only alumni of the program have access.
